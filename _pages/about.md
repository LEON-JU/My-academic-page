I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SLAM and computer vision.

# Projects

## BME1102-druid_project
An animal supervision system based on python which also includes a learning based computer vision classification module.
