I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SLAM and computer vision.

# Projects

## [BME1102-druid_project](https://github.com/LEON-JU/BME1102-druid_project)
An animal supervision system based on python which also includes a learning based computer vision classification module.

## [Othello_CS181project](https://github.com/LEON-JU/Othello_CS181)
Reinforce learning othello agents implemented in three different methods: Greedy, Monte Carlo Tree Search and Q-Learning with DQN.

## [Disentangling Object Motion for Self-supervised Depth Estimation](https://github.com/LEON-JU/CS172-mono-depth-estimation)
Our CS172 final project, we made some improvements based on Dynamic Depth, managing to predict better depth image under dynamic scenes.

## [Crowd-count-based-on-resnet](https://github.com/LEON-JU/Crowd-count-based-on-resnet)
My CS172 homework, training Resnet to count the number of people in Shanghaitech crowd counting dataset.

## [Geometry to the rescue in pytorch](https://github.com/LEON-JU/Geometry-to-the-rescue-in-pytorch)
My CS172 homework, replication of the paper "Unsupervised CNN for single view depth estimation: Geometry to the rescue" in pytorch.

## [Train nerf](https://github.com/LEON-JU/Train_nerf)
My CS172 homework, training nerf on self-customed datasets.
